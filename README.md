# Project Euler problem solutions
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) is a website for math and CS enthusiasts. It has hundreds of problems to be solved and all have a single number as final result.
The challenge is finding the way to compute that number correctly, in any programming language. 

In this folder you will find my answers to some of the problems there. All problems here were solved using Python.
